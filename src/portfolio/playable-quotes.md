## What are Playable Quotes?
[Playable Quotes](https://tenmile.quote.games/) are what a video clip is to movies, a line of text is to books. It answers the question of how do we share moments in games with others. Right now, we usually share our favorite gaming moments with videos or pictures. But games are not just something we watch, like movies. We also interact with them. [Playable Quotes](https://tenmile.quote.games/) aims to improve this, by adding limited interactivity for a shared moment.

An Example of a prototype playable quote: (interacting will not pause the input sequence, but still allow control)
<tenmile-quote src="https://tenmile.s3.amazonaws.com/STAR%20WARS-N-7482-4bbde532.png" controls autoplay>Luke jumps up and down without any horizontal motion.</tenmile-quote>

## My Contributions
My contributions can be broadly categorized into 2 categories.
* [Prototyping and Ideas](/portfolio/playable-quotes/prototyping-and-ideas)
* [Mupen64 Savestates](/portfolio/playable-quotes/mupen64-pq)

In [Prototyping and Ideas](/portfolio/playable-quotes/prototyping-and-ideas), which encompasses the first half of my internship, I worked alone and collaboratively to discover and demonstrate use cases and improve ui.


In [Mupen64 Savestates](/portfolio/playable-quotes/mupen64-pq), I dive into exploring the possiblity of savestates from a N64 emulator using Mario 64.
