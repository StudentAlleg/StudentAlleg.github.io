# WIP
## Overview
TODO : Overview what learned / Did

Full Stack Web development with react,
Did multiple projects, some focusing front, back, and db. Final assignment was a react MUI material based full stack mock email client.

# Notable Projects
## Assignment 3
Building off of the Assignment 2 javascript date picker, Assignment 3 had us build a React date picker. To complete the entire assignment, the date picker needed the following functionality:
* Display Month/Year. On Click: Return to selected date
* Buttons to increase or decrease month
* Display all dates in the current month
* Display extra dates of previous and next month
* Show a selected date
* Have a text input box to input a specific date
* Have a button that when clicked would select that specific date

### Reflection
This was the first exposure I had to using React, everything else done in the course (pure javascript and CSS) I had done before. 

### Assignment X

# Code
Implementation of these assignments will be shared only on request, due to instructor restrictions.
