I am a 23 year old College Graduate from UCSC. I have a major in Computer Science: Game Design and a minor in Computer Science. As you might expect, I enjoy playing games in my free time (currently Foxhole and Factorio). I also enjoy reading and public transit.
I am currently working on [Clans](https://wiki.betterpvp.net/clans/), a Minecraft factions-like gamemode with customizable classes.
